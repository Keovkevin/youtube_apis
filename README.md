# youtube_apis
To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

# Basic Requirements
- Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.
- A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
- A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.
- Dockerize the project.
- It should be scalable and optimised.

    - To fetch the latest videos you need to specify these: type=video, order=date, publishedAfter=<SOME_DATE_TIME>
    - Without publishedAfter, it will give you cached results which will be too old
